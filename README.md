# Sales_Data_Analysis_and_Visualization


📊 Sales Data Analysis Dashboard
A Streamlit web application that performs descriptive and inferential statistical analysis on randomly generated sales data. This interactive dashboard visualizes business insights, computes statistical measures, and conducts hypothesis testing — all in real-time.

🚀 Features
Dynamic Sales Dataset
Automatically generates a 20-product sales dataset with synthetic attributes like product category, units sold, and timestamped sales dates.

Descriptive Statistics
Displays statistical summaries such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for sales units.

Category-Level Insights
Aggregates and visualizes sales performance across different product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home, Books).

Inferential Statistics
Calculates confidence intervals for mean sales and performs a one-sample t-test to assess statistical significance against a population mean.


Visual Analytics

Histogram with KDE for unit distribution
Category-wise box plots
Aggregated bar charts of total sales
Interactive UI
Expandable sections for summary statistics
Real-time statistical recalculations
Clean, responsive Streamlit interface


🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

Streamlit – UI framework for building interactive data apps

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – Numerical operations and random data generation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

SciPy – Statistical analysis (confidence intervals, t-tests)

📈 Statistical Components
Section	Description
Descriptive Stats	Computes mean, median, mode, variance, and std deviation for units sold.
Category Summary	Aggregates total and average sales per product category.
Confidence Interval	Estimates 95% CI for mean units sold.
T-Test	Tests if the average units sold differ significantly from 20.
🎨 Visualizations
Histogram: Distribution of unit_sold with descriptive markers

Boxplot: Spread of sales across product categories

Bar Chart: Total units sold per category

Each chart is generated dynamically with clean color palettes and labeled axes.



🧾 Example Output Summary
Mean unit sold ≈ 20

95% Confidence Interval ≈ (17.8, 22.4)

Hypothesis Test Result → Fail to reject null hypothesis (p > 0.05)

(Note: Results will vary per run due to random data generation.)
